# react-rss-brand-news + Accessibility



## Second Step - the website is ready


In this step I've created the news pages and make them working properly.

see there the website: 

https://lingar-poc.github.io/react-rss-brand-news/#/

**Notice - there are probably some more efficient or elegant  ways to do 
those things. Anyway for the current need what there is- is enough.

TODO next: 

Make better static icons, and content.
Maybe use another hooks or promises for make things work better.
