# react-rss-brand-news + Accessibility


## First Step 

In this step we have created the first template for the website. 

I took the template from here : 

https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page137/megazzine

I build the app with this template and have added 3 pages for each provider.

Next, I will do in the main page the latest news of 3 providers, and at 
each tab will be only the latest news of the specific provider.

You can switch between the pages and see how the provider "name" is changed.

See here for more details:
