# react-rss-brand-news + Accessibility

This is the very first beginning of the project. 
In this project you can track and see how I'm implementing accessibility inside
website. 

I will first build RSS new feeds of some providers, then I will show how I'm 
inserting accessibility to the website. 

You can track by the branch on the working process.
